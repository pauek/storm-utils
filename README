Quick hack to install STORM in a VirtualBox cluster 
(you'd better have a Core i7 with lots of RAM)

1. Install an Ubuntu Server 10.04 LTS as a VirtualBox Guest
2. download 'storm-utils'.
3. Execute scripts 01 through 05:
4. Clone the virtual machines in "link mode" (now you'll have STORM in all of them).
5. Execute script 06 in each node:
 
   > sudo ./06-config-zookeeper-node.sh n 3  # where 'n' is the node number, and 
                                             # 3 is the total number of VMs

The addresses are 192.168.1.200 + i, with i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ... please don't ask why.
